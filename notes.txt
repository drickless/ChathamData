[?] add FIRM layer and other physical features to svi 
[?] account for public/industrial land

find which block group each survey point is in 
create attribute sviscore = the score for that block group
regression: sviscore ~ survey vars 


add to survey points an attribute SVI
for each block group in svi output
	select the survey points that are inside the block group
	SVI = sumscores
	deselect



-----

Build SVI 
	Run PCA on census data
	Choose 4 components based on Kaiser rule
	Evaluate components
	Reverse cardinality of PC1 as it represents wealth/white
	Apply varimax rotation to scores to reduce loading on multiple comps
	Calculate weighted sum based on perc variance explained

Export SVI scores to CSV --> svi_output.csv
Join + append scores to CBG feature class --> chathamGropus_svi.shp
Use Add Polygon Attributes to Points to assign SVI scores to survey points --> pointsSVI.shp
Export attributes as CSV --> SVIsurvey.csv
